Elite 4 English: Metapod's Trial

Story Backdrop
For reasons known only to you, you have decided to challenge the entirety of the Pokemon League with only a Metapod. The Elite Four, on the other hand, have decided to sic their Gyarados on you.

With only a Metapod on your team, all you can do is run, use Harden to raise your meager defenses, and shoot Stringshots in an attempt to slow Gyarados' Speed.
Even Metapod's "attacks" are limited, however, by thePowerPoint counter. When those PowerPoints run out, your Metapod will be left with only the option to Struggle and damage itself in the process--which really isn't that much of an option at all, right?

Evade Gyarados' powerful attacks as you answer the Elite Four's questions. The Elite Four ain't no dummies though, so if they see your Metapod attaining even a modicum of success in passing their trial, they will attack with even more ferocity in hopes of getting to the gooey center underneath your Metapod's crunchy shell.

Don't let them get to the center of your Tootsie Roll Pop and push through! Do it in a prompt enough manner and you might even enter the Pokemon League Hall of Fame...
